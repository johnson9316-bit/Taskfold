// Taskfold plugin module decides whether a card's recorded run is still alive.
//
// These are pure decisions: given a card and the current time, say whether the run
// it claims to be executing is live, stuck, or gone, and what the card's status and
// execution status should become. The browser previously owned this logic, which
// meant card state only converged while somebody had the board open.
// `reconciler.ts` collects the inputs and applies the results.
//
// The evidence is local on purpose. A linked plugin cannot read host run state
// after the fact — every avenue was tried against a live Gateway and none work:
//   - `runtime.gateway.request("sessions.list")` is refused for any plugin that is
//     not bundled or trusted-official.
//   - `runtime.tasks.runs.bindSession({sessionKey})` scopes every lookup to
//     `task.ownerKey`, which for a Taskfold run is the *requester* session that
//     spawned the subagent, not the card's own session, and the dispatch path never
//     learns it.
//   - `runtime.subagent.waitForRun({runId})` answers "timeout" for any run not live
//     in the current process, so it cannot distinguish finished from forgotten.
// What remains is decisive enough: a working worker heartbeats, and a worker that
// died with the Gateway does not.
//
// One trap to leave alone: `sessions.list` reports agent-scoped keys
// (`agent:main:subagent:…`) while a card without an explicit `agentId` stores the
// unscoped tail. The host resolves either form, so every host call still works — but
// a literal comparison between the two never matches, and the previous version of
// this module made exactly that comparison to decide a run was orphaned.
