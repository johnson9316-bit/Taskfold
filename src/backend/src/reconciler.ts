// Taskfold plugin module reconciles card state against the evidence a run leaves
// behind.
//
// This is the control loop. It runs in the Gateway process, on a timer plus once at
// startup, so a card converges whether or not anybody has the board open.
// Previously the equivalent logic lived in the browser, which meant an unattended
// Gateway left finished runs marked "running" forever, and a Gateway restart
// orphaned every in-flight run with nothing to clean it up.
//
// Outcomes for runs that finish normally arrive through the `subagent_ended` hook in
// `index.ts`. This loop exists for the case that hook cannot cover: the process died
// before the event was delivered. See `lifecycle.ts` for why that judgement is made
// from local evidence instead of asking the host.
